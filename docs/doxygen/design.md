### Design 

* Highly scalable and performant collectives for HPC, AI/ML and I/O workloads
* Nonblocking collective operations that cover a variety of programming models
* Flexible resource allocation model
* Support for relaxed ordering model
* Flexible synchronous model
* Repetitive collective operations (init once and invoke multiple times)
* Hardware collectives are a first-class citizen
