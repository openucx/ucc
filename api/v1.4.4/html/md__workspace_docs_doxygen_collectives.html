<div class="textblock"><p>A UCC collective operation is a group communication operation among the participants of the team. All participants of the team are required to call the collective operation. Each participant is represented by the endpoint that is unique to the team used for the collective operation. This section provides a set of routines for launching, progressing, and completing the collective operations.</p>
<p><b>Invocation semantics</b>: The ucc_collective_init routine is a non-blocking collective operation to initialize the buffers, operation type, reduction type, and other information required for the collective operation. All participants of the team should call the initialize operation. The collective operation is invoked using a ucc_collective_post operation. ucc_collective_init_and_post operation initializes as well as post the collective operation.</p>
<p><b>Collective Type</b>: The collective operation supported by UCC is defined by the enumeration ucc_coll_type_t. The semantics are briefly described here, however in most cases it agrees with the semantics of collective operations in the popular programming models such as MPI and OpenSHMEM. When they differ, the semantics changes are documented. All collective operations execute on the team. For the collective operations defined by ucc_coll_type_t, all participants of the team are required to participate in the collective operations. Further the team should be created with endpoints, where the “eps” should be ordered and contiguous.</p>
<p>UCC supports three types of collective operations: (a) UCC_{ALLTOALL, ALLTOALLV, ALLGATHER, ALLGATHERV, ALLREDUCE, REDUCE_SCATTER, REDUCE_SCATTERV, BARRIER} operations where all participants contribute to the results and receive the results (b) UCC_{REDUCE, GATHER, GATHERV, FANIN} where all participants contribute to the result and one participant receives the result. The participant receiving the result is designated as root. (c) UCC_{BROADCAST, SCATTER, SCATTERV, FANOUT} where one participant contributes to the result, and all participants receive the result. The participant contributing to the result is designated as root.</p>
<ul>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_BCAST operation moves the data from the root participant to all participants in the team.</li>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_BARRIER synchronizes all participants of the collective operation. In this routine, first, each participant waits for all other participants to enter the operation. Then, once it learns the entry of all other participants into the operation, it exits the operation completing it locally.</li>
<li>In the UCC_COLL_TYPE_FAN_IN operation, the root participant synchronizes with all participants of the team. The non-root completes when it sends synchronizing message to the root. Unlike UCC_COLL_TYPE_BARRIER, it doesn’t have to synchronize with the rest of the non-root participants. The root participant completes the operation when it receives synchronizing messages from all non-root participants of the team.</li>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_FAN_OUT operation is a synchronizing operation like UCC_COLL_TYPE_FAN_OUT. In this operation, the root participant sends a synchronizing message to all non-root participants and completes. The non-root participant completes once it receives a message from the root participant.</li>
<li>In the UCC_COLL_TYPE_GATHER operation, each participant of the collective operation sends data to the root participant. All participants send the same amount of data (block_size) to the root. The size of the block is “dt_elem_size * count”. The total amount of data received by the root is equal to block_size * num_participants. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes. The "num_participants" represents the number of participants in the team. The data on the root is placed in the receive buffer ordered by the “ep” ordering. For example, if the participants’ endpoints are ordered as “ep_a” to “ep_n”, the data from the participant with ep_i is placed as an “ith” block on the receive buffer.</li>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_ALLGATHER operation is similar to UCC_COLL_TYPE_GATHER with one exception. Unlike in GATHER operation, the result is available at all participants’ receive buffer instead of only at the root participant. <pre class="fragment">Each participant sends the data of size "block_size" to all other participants
</pre> in the collective operation. The size of the block is “dt_elem_size * count”. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes. The data on each participant is placed in the receive buffer ordered by the “ep” ordering. For example, if the participants’ endpoints are ordered as “ep_a” to “ep_n”, the data from the participant with ep_i is placed as an “ith” block on the receive buffer.</li>
<li>In the UCC_COLL_TYPE_SCATTER operation, the root participant of the collective operation sends data to all other participants. It sends the same amount of data (block_size) to all participants. The size of the block (block_size) is “dt_elem_size * count”. The total amount of data sent by the root is equal to block_size * num_participants. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes. The "num_participants" represents the number of participants in the team.</li>
<li>In the UCC_COLL_TYPE_ALLTOALL collective operation, all participants exchange a fixed amount of the data. For a given participant, the size of data in src buffer is “size”, where size is dt_elem_size * count * num_participants. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements per destination. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes. The "num_participants" represents the number of participants in the team. The size of src buffer is the same as the dest buffer, and it is the same across all participants. Each participant exchanges “dt_elem_size * count “ data with every participant of the collective.</li>
<li>In UCC_COLL_TYPE_REDUCE collective the element-wise reduction operation is performed on the src buffer of all participants in the collective operation. The result is stored on the dst buffer of the root. The size of src buffer and dst buffer is the same, which is equal to “dt_elem_size * count”. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes.</li>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_ALLREDUCE first performs an element-wise reduction on the src buffers of all participants. Then the result is distributed to all participants. After the operation, the results are available on the dst buffer of all participants. The size of src buffer and dst buffer is the same for all participants. The size of src buffer and dst buffer is the same, which is equal to “dt_elem_size * count”. Here, the “count” represents the number of data elements. The "dt_elem_size" represents the size of the data element in bytes.</li>
<li>The UCC_COLL_TYPE_REDUCE_SCATTER first performs an element-wise reduction on the src buffer and then scatters the result to the dst buffer. The "size" of src buffer is “count * dt_elem_size”, where dt_elem_size is the number of bytes for the data type element and count is the number of elements of that datatype. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that data and the result are equally divisible among the participants. Assuming that the result is divided into “n” blocks, the ith block is placed in the receive buffer of endpoint “i”. Like other collectives, for this collective, the “ep” should be ordered and contiguous.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>INPLACE</b>: When INPLACE is set for UCC_COLL_TYPE_REDUCE_SCATTER, UCC_COLL_TYPE_REDUCE, UCC_COLL_TYPE_ALLREDUCE, UCC_COLL_TYPE_SCATTER, and UCC_COLL_TYPE_ALLTOALL the receive buffers act as both send and receive buffer.</p>
<p>For UCC_COLL_TYPE_BCAST operation, setting INPLACE flag has no impact.</p>
<p><b>The "v" Variant Collective Types</b>: The UCC_COLL_TYPE_{ALLTOALLV, SCATTERV, GATHERV, and REDUCE_SCATTERV} operations add flexibility to their counter parts (.i.e., ALLTOALL, SCATTER, GATHER, and REDUCE_SCATTER) in that the location of data for the send and receive are specified by displacement arrays.</p>
<p><b>Reduction Types</b>: The reduction operation supported by UCC_{ALLREDUCE, REDUCE, REDUCE_SCATTER, REDUCE_SCATTERV} operation is defined by the enumeration ucc_reduction_op_t. The valid datatypes for the reduction is defined by the enumeration ucc_datatype_t.</p>
<p><b>Ordering:</b> The team can be configured for ordered collective operations or unordered collective operations. For unordered collectives, the user is required to provide the “tag”, which is an unsigned 64-bit integer.</p>
<p><b>Synchronized</b> and Non-Synchronized Collectives: In the synchronized collective model, on entry, the participants cannot read or write to other participants without ensuring all participants have entered the collective operation. On the exit of the collective operation, the participants may exit after all participants have completed the reading or writing to the buffers.</p>
<p>In the non-synchronized collective model, on entry, the participants can read or write to other participants. If the input and output buffers are defined on the team and RMA operations are used for data transfer, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure the readiness of the buffer. On exit, the participants may exit once the read and write to the local buffers are completed.</p>
<p><b>Buffer</b> Ownership: The ownership of input and output buffers are transferred from the user to the library after invoking the ucc_collective_init routine. On return from the routine, the ownership is transferred back to the user on ucc_collective_finalize. However, after invoking and returning from ucc_collective_post or ucc_collective_init_and_post routines, the ownership stays with the library and it is returned to the user, when the collective is completed.</p>
<p><b>The</b> table below lists the necessary fields that user must initialize depending on the collective operation type.   </p>
