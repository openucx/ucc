* Nonblocking collective operations that cover a variety of programming models
* Flexible resource allocation model
* Support for relaxed ordering model
* Flexible synchronous model 
* Repetitive collective operations (init once and invoke multiple times)
* Hardware collectives are a first-class citizen
